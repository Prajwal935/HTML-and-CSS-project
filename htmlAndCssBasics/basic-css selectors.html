        Fireworks are also a common way to celebrate, lighting up the sky in a colorful display of national pride. People often come together with family and friends, enjoying the day with food, music, and other festivities. Independence Day is more than just a celebration; it's a day for reflection on the values of freedom, unity, and the continued efforts to build a better future for the nation.
